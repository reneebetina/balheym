HOW TO DUPLICATE ITEMS INSIDE CHEST IN YOUR WORLD

1. Place all your inventory items inside your chests and all you want to duplicate

2. GO TO
...\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds

3. Copy <yourWorld>.db and <yourWorld>.fwl
and paste it inside the same folder with name backup after the extension. e.g (<yourWorld>.db.back)

4. This is your base world for now, then proceed getting the items you wanna duplicate inside the chest, put in your inventory then exit the game.

5. delete the <yourWorld>.db and copy paste the .db.back file and rename it to <yourWorld>.db

6. repeat step 5 until you have full inventory.

Enjoy :)
